Example:

/* offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius | spread-radius | color */
box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);

Well, imagine that the box shadow starts as a box, the same size as the content, of the specified shadow colour (say black for argument's sake).

This box starts life the same size and shape as the content, and right behind it - so, essentially, invisible.

The two distance values will shift it up, down, left or right - so that it will "peek" out from behind the content. At this point, it will still be a box of the same size as its content, and will have sharp edges.

The spread value will cause this box to expand by the specified amount - so it will be bigger or smaller than its content box. Visually, the higher the spread, the further "back" the shadow appears (it gives the illusion that the box is a long way away from the surface that it's casting its shadow on).

The blur value simply causes the edges to blur smoothly into the background, fading from the shadow colour to the background colour.
